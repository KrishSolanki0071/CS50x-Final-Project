# RESPONSIVE REGISTRATION FORM 
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/XExAeXSJ2Hk>
#### Description:
I made a registration form similar to a google form and by taking inspirations/ideas from some Youtube videos.
But it isn't like an ordinary google form, my registration form has a moving wallpaper behind in the background 
and some ui modifications also with a soothing background music!

The ".html" file is the one which displays all the input informations with the ".css" file giving all the UI mods
and all the animations including the background.
